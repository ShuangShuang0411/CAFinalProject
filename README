High-order Data Reconstruction in Hydro

This is the final project for Computational Astrophysics 2022, by Shuang-Shuang Chen and Hao-Yang Hsu.


The following is a brief description on how to use the code:

1. First you can modify filename.cpp, and compile it using "sh compile.sh filename.cpp". The executable filename.out will then be generated and put in bin/ directory.
2. Run the code by commanding "./bin/filename.out", it will generate a data_evol.txt file containing the results in the same directory (bin/).
3. Plot the data by commanding "python filename.py" in the main directory.


The description of the files:

DataReconstruct_ShockTube.cpp:    the main code of PCM, PLM and PPM, with the shock tube problem.
DataReconstruct_AcousticWave.cpp: the code of PCM, PLM and PPM, with the acoustic wave problem to test order of accuracy.
GP_1D_Hydro_HLLC_evol.cpp:        the main code of GP, with the acoustic wave problem.
Cha_tracing_PPM.cpp:              the code of PPM with characteristic tracing test (method of Stone et al. 2018).
CW_PPM.cpp:                       the code of PPM (method of Colella & Woodward 1984).
1D_evol_shocktube.py:             plot the evolved data from DataReconstruct_ShockTube.cpp, Cha_tracing_PPM.cpp, CW_PPM.cpp.
1D_evol_acoustic.py:              plot the evolved data from GP_1D_Hydro_HLLC_evol.cpp.
plot_AcousticWave.py:             plot the evolved data from DataReconstruct_AcousticWave.cpp.
ac_DataReconstruct_ShockTube.cpp: test the order of accuracy of DataReconstruct_ShockTube.cpp.
ac_CW_PPM.cpp:                    test the order of accuracy of CW_PPM.cpp.
ac_1D_evol.py:                    calculate the order of accuracy of ac_DataReconstruct_ShockTube.cpp, ac_CW_PPM.cpp.
Sod_Shock_Tube:                   the analytical solution for shock tube problem at T=0.1.
